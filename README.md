## :information_source: Preamble

> `"Vanilla Plus Requiem List"`
> 
> `"Good visuals for low vram GPU's"`
>
> `"Simple,optimized and well thought"`

**Just Another Requiem List** (J.A.R.L) is designed as a simple requiem modlist.

J.A.R.L seeks to improve the gameplay and visuals while also remaining playable for the vast majority of people who don't own high end GPU's.

## :computer: System Requirements

### Disclaimer

Owing to the need to clean master files and certain errors with Wabbajack, J.A.R.L only supports **English Steam** versions of Skyrim AE. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**.

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is **STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST**. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and ram is needed.

***

### Recommended System Requirements
- A CPU with a good enough single core performance
- 16GB DDR4 Ram
- SSD
- A GPU with at least 4gb VRAM

My specs (1080p):

- Ryzen 3 3100
- 16GB DDR4
- NVME M.2
- RTX 3070

Space required: Approx 86GB (Downloads included) + 30GB working room for Wabbajack.

## :page_facing_up: Installation

Installing J.A.R.L is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### :clipboard: Pre-Installation

Prior to installing J.A.R.L, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Start the game to the main menu in order to download all the creations.
8. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.
9. Install Creation Kit(Clean install)

### :page_with_curl: Wabbajack Installation

#### :scroll: Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

:warning: **NOTE**: J.A.R.L will **always** require the latest version of Wabbajack **UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE**. :warning:

#### :open_file_folder: Downloading and Installing J.A.R.L

Downloading and installing J.A.R.L can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install AVO, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists. Check the tickbox that says `show unofficial`.
2. Press the download button on "Just Another Requiem List" and wait for it to download.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Skyrim_Modlists\Just Another Requiem List. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### :confused: Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
   
- x is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- You did not follow the steps in [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation). Go back and follow it.
	- If you have followed it then you can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## :floppy_disk: Post-Installation


### :file_folder: Stock Game

J.A.R.L utilises a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatability with other mod-lists.

***

### :telescope: Post Processing

**NOTE**: Screenshots save to `Just Another Requiem List\Game Root\[NoDelete] Screenshots\Character Name`.

**NOTE**: By default, the list is **capped at 72fps**. To change this, you will need to adjust the `ini` file in `SSE Display Tweaks`.

## :arrow_forward: Playing the List

***

### :runner:  Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `SKSE` and press the `Run` button.

### :bookmark: In-Game MCM options

You can tweak anything you want,most of them are self explanitory

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.
